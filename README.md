# Drone System Monitoring  with AI Agents

This project is a comprehensive **drone management system** designed to monitor drones during mass events, detect incidents, and generate reports using **AI agents**. The system provides a unified dashboard interface for drone operators, including real-time monitoring, incident tracking, and system analytics.

The project is structured as a **monorepo** that includes both frontend and backend components. The backend manages drone data and incident detection, while the frontend offers an interactive user interface. AI agents are responsible for detecting incidents, managing drone routes, and handling operational tasks with minimal human intervention.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **Drone Monitoring**: Real-time drone location and status tracking on an interactive map.
- **Incident Detection and Reporting**: AI agents automatically detect and report incidents in real-time.
- **System Status**: Dashboard displays the current state of drones, incidents, and system performance.
- **AI Agent Integration**: AI agents handle incident detection, route management, and report generation.
- **Simplified UI**: Clean and user-friendly dashboard for quick access to key information.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend:**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances React with static typing for better code reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and custom styling.
- **Mapbox**: Provides the interactive map for visualizing drone locations.
- **D3.js**: Used for generating data visualizations (graphs, charts) in the dashboard.

### **Backend:**

- **NestJS**: A scalable Node.js framework for building efficient server-side applications.
- **Express**: (used within NestJS) Web framework for creating the backend API to manage drone data and incidents.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing drone data, incidents, and system logs.
- **AI Agents**: Custom AI agents are responsible for detecting incidents, generating reports, and managing drones in real-time.
- **Image Recognition**: AI models process drone footage to detect objects and incidents automatically.

### **AI Components:**

- **Machine Learning**: Pre-trained models are used for incident detection and object recognition from drone footage.
- **AI Agents**: These agents are responsible for monitoring drone activities, analyzing footage, detecting anomalies, and sending alerts to the dashboard.

# üìç General Project Roadmap

### Step 1: MVP Interface Creation ![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In_Progress-yellow?style=flat-square)

### Step 2: Backend API Setup
- [ ] Set up the **NestJS** backend framework.
  - Create initial endpoints for drone data, incidents, and basic status monitoring.

### Step 3: Database Integration
- [ ] Integrate **MongoDB** for storing drone position data, incident reports, and system logs.
  - Establish data schemas for drones, incidents, and system status.

### Step 4: AI Agent Initialization
- [ ] Implement basic **AI agents** responsible for monitoring drone activities.
  - Design core logic for incident detection using AI models.

### Step 5: Real-Time Monitoring and Map Integration
- [ ] Integrate the interactive **Mapbox** map to display real-time drone positions.
  - Connect the map with backend data to show active drone locations.

### Step 6: Image Recognition Integration
- [ ] Set up **image recognition** capabilities to analyze static images from drones.
  - Implement object detection models to identify incidents based on drone footage.

### Step 7: Incident Detection and Reporting
- [ ] Enhance **AI agents** to automatically detect and classify incidents.
  - Generate real-time reports and visualize them on the dashboard.

### Step 8: System Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] Add system status analytics and trends using **D3.js** charts.
  - Visualize drone activity over time and system performance metrics.

### Step 9: Advanced AI Agent Features
